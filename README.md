# GLogin
**GLogin** stands for **GNOME Login Prompt** and is a simple GTK+ login prompt for Debian GNU/Linux,
including Debian derivatives like Ubuntu.

## Install
Check your distribution with the following command:
```shell
lsb_release -a
```
This should output something like this:
```
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu Kinetic Kudu (development branch)
Release:        22.10
Codename:       kinetic
```
Check if Git (the VCS used by GitHub) is installed by running:
```shell
which git
```
This should output something like:
```
/usr/bin/git
```
Now we clone this repository and install the prompt:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Tyler887/glogin.git
cd glogin
sudo bash install.sh
```
All dependenices, including the Zenity low-level GNOME window frontend, will be installed,
and GLogin will be installed as a daemon that starts after the GNOME display manager.

Reboot your OS and you will see the new login prompt. Enter your username and password,
and voil√°! You got logged in from the magic prompt!
